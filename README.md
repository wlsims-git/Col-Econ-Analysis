# Analysis of Economic Impacts of Venezuelan Migrants and Refugees in Colombia (2018)

This repository contains preliminary econometric analysis of the relationship between Venezuelan forced migration and the economic prospects (employment, wages, and business ownership) of native Colombians. It contains the following files:

1. Two cleaned and merged datasets from Colombia's GEIH
2. R code used to perform the analysis
3. A paper documenting the analysis results

The project was not completed because similar analysis was published by Leonardo Pe√±aloza Pacheco in his paper [Living with the Neighbors: The Effect of Venezuelan Forced Migration on Wages in Colombia](http://www.cedlas.econo.unlp.edu.ar/wp/wp-content/uploads/doc_cedlas248.pdf).
